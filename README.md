Hello World
A README.md file is a text file that provides information about a project. It is typically the first file that users see when they encounter a project, so it is important to make it clear, concise, and informative.

README.md files are written in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. Markdown can be used to format text, add links, and create images and tables.

README.md files typically include the following information:

Project name and description: What is the project? What does it do?
Installation instructions: How do users install and run the project?
Usage instructions: How do users use the project?
Documentation: Links to other documentation, such as API documentation or tutorials.
Contributing guidelines: How can users contribute to the project?
License: What license is the project released under?
README.md files can also be used to include other information, such as:

Troubleshooting: How can users troubleshoot common problems?
FAQ: Answers to frequently asked questions.
Changelog: A list of changes that have been made to the project.
Roadmap: A plan for future development of the project.
README.md files are an important part of any open source project. They help users to understand what the project is, how to use it, and how to contribute to it.

Here are some tips for writing a good README.md file:

Be clear and concise.
Use Markdown to format your text.
Include all of the essential information, such as the project name and description, installation instructions, usage instructions, and documentation.
Consider adding other information, such as troubleshooting, FAQ, changelog, and roadmap.
Proofread your README.md file carefully before publishing it.
